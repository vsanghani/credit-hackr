      <p>Whether you're new to the points game or a seasoned churner, the landscape of frequent flyer programs is always changing. In 2024, the focus has shifted towards flexible reward programs and finding value in everyday spend.</p>
      
      <h3>1. Don't Ignore Grocery Rewards</h3>
      <p>One of the easiest ways to accumulate points is through your weekly shop. Both Coles (Flybuys) and Woolworths (Everyday Rewards) offer excellent conversion rates to major airlines. Keep an eye out for bonus point multipliers on gift cards!</p>

      <h3>2. The Power of "Double Dipping"</h3>
      <p>Using a rewards credit card to pay for a purchase that also earns loyalty points is the classic double dip. For example, booking a Qantas flight with a Qantas-earning credit card earns you points from the airline AND the bank.</p>

      <h3>3. Sign-up Bonuses are Key</h3>
      <p>The fastest way to a free flight is often a large sign-up bonus. Many cards offer 60,000 to 100,000 bonus points just for meeting a minimum spend requirement in the first few months.</p>

      <p>It's the age-old debate in the credit card world: is cash king, or do points reign supreme? The answer depends largely on your spending habits and travel goals.</p>

      <h3>Cashback Pros</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> No complex redemption charts or blackout dates.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Use the money for anything - groceries, bills, or savings.</li>
        <li><strong>Guaranteed Value:</strong> You know exactly what 1% or 2% back is worth.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Points Pros</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Potential Value:</strong> Redeeming for international business class flights can yield values of 3-5 cents per point, far outstripping cashback rates.</li>
        <li><strong>Perks:</strong> Points cards often come with travel insurance, lounge access, and concierge services.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> If you travel internationally at least once a year, points usually win on value. If you prefer keeping fees low and rewards simple, stick to cashback.</p>

        content: `
      <p>Complimentary travel insurance is a massive perk of premium credit cards, potentially saving you hundreds of dollars per trip. However, it's not always automatic.</p>

      <h3>How to Activate</h3>
      <p>Most insurers require you to spend a certain amount of your prepaid travel costs (like flights or accommodation) on the card to activate cover. This is typically usually $250 or $500.</p>

      <h3>What's Usually Covered?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Medical emergencies overseas</li>
        <li>Lost luggage</li>
        <li>Trip cancellation (checks terms carefully)</li>
        <li>Rental car excess waiver</li>
      </ul>

      <p><em>Always read the PDS (Product Disclosure Statement) before relying on card insurance, as coverage limits and exclusions vary significantly between banks.</em></p>
